To get this to work, you need to do the following:
  Update the 'ACCESS_TOKEN' constant found at the top of the 'app.js' script with the correct access token else it will never return any results.
  Run 'install.bat' to install the relevant node modules
  Run 'run.bat' to start the server
  Visit localhost:3000 in your browser to view the frontend
